## Let's make the world better!

Hi! I'm an analyst-turned-dev who wants to work towards building a better future through data, maps, code, and design.

- I'm currently learning about maze-generation and path-finding algorithms.
- I’m currently learning Javascript and web frameworks, but want to branch out into lower-level languages.
- I’m looking to collaborate on open data and open source projects.
- I’m looking for help with gaining a deeper understanding graph theory.
- Ask me about art, maps, and games.
