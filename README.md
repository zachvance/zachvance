## Let's make the world better!

Hi! I'm an analyst-turned-dev who wants to work towards building a better future through data, maps, code, and design.

- I’m currently working on a full-stack operational procedures application for my organization.
- I’m currently learning Python, but want to branch out into lower-level languages and web.
- I’m looking to collaborate on open data and open source projects.
- I’m looking for help with gaining a deeper understanding graph problems, in the context of how they can be solved with Python.
- Ask me about art, maps, and games.
- How to reach me: zvance@yourbus.com
