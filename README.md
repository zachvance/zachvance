## Let's make the world better!

Hi! I'm a multidiciplinary analyst-turned-dev who wants to work towards building a better future through code, maps, data, and design.

- I'm currently learning about maze-generation and path-finding algorithms.
- I’m currently learning Javascript to level up my web-dev and looking to explore other languages to broaden my language familiarity.
- I’m looking to collaborate on open data and open source projects.

Let's chat about art, maps, space, AI, procedural generation, and games.
